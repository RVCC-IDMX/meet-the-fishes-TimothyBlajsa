# The Surreal Aquarium Slideshow
Welcome to the new iteration of the aquarium...included are the following:
## Features
This new version includes an interactive slideshow, profiling a different fish on each scene.
- Title Screen
- Rainbow Fish
- Betta Fish
- Silver Fish

The above scenes include various animations, in addition to their base state. As well as the following sprites:
- Big Fish
- SMall Fish
- Betta Fish
- Background
- Kelp
- Coral
- Bubbles

Each scene is navigated with the inclusion of back and next buttons, accompanied by a custom blinking transition.

The background remains the same from the previous iteration, including animated bubbles, sound, and kelp.
## Author Testimony
This iteration of the project was smooth for the most part, save for simple typos that were sorted out and corrected. The main hurtle was with designing a custom transition; my final solution was to combine the logic of the fade transition with the built-in filter capability of PIXI.
